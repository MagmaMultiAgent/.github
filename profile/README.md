# VigIL - Lux AI Competition

This repository contains a thesis research exploring **Scalable Multi-Agent RL Solutions**, along with a partial submission and template for the LuxAI competition.

The **Lux AI Challenge** is a competition where competitors design agents to tackle a multi-variable optimization, resource gathering, and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against other competitors. In addition to optimization, successful agents must be capable of analyzing their opponents and developing appropriate policies to get the upper hand.
