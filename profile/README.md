# MagMA - Large Scale Mult-Agent Tooling

This repository contains a thesis research exploring **Scalable Multi-Agent RL Solutions**, along with a partial submission and template for the LuxAI competition.

The **Lux AI Challenge** is a competition where competitors design agents to tackle a multi-variable optimization, resource gathering, and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against other competitors. In addition to optimization, successful agents must be capable of analyzing their opponents and developing appropriate policies to get the upper hand.

Our project contains two repositories:

- **Magma Core**: Contains the core code and implementation
- **Magma Viz**: Web-based visualization tool for training agents
